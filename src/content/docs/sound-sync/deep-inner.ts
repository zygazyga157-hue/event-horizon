        "The Deep Inner state represents a profound inward shift of awareness characterized by minimal bodily sensation, reduced external awareness, and access to deep subconscious and archetypal mental material.",
        "Within Project ZYGA - SM, Deep Inner is considered a LOW-AWARENESS / HIGH-DEPTH state, entered after stabilization in the Mind Awake / Body Asleep (MABA) state.",
        "It is not intended as an entry state, but as a depth phase.",
        "This state corresponds to Gateway Experience 'Focus 12' and beyond — states described as 'expanded awareness' where consciousness operates independently of physical sensory input.",

      title: "Gateway Experience Context",
      content: [
        "The CIA's Gateway analysis describes advanced Focus states as accessing 'the dimension of intuitive, holistic thought' where 'the brain is accessing information from the universal hologram.'",
        "Focus 12 is defined as 'a state of expanded awareness' — Deep Inner extends this into even lower frequency domains approaching sleep threshold.",
        "According to the Gateway document: 'When the brain is brought into a state of coherence... it becomes capable of collecting information from sources not normally available to ordinary consciousness.'",
        "The document references physicist David Bohm's holographic universe theory: 'The brain... is itself a hologram which is part of a larger hologram — the universe itself.'",
        "Deep Inner accesses what Gateway terms 'the realm of the subconscious' — Theta and Delta frequencies where archetypal material and non-local information become accessible.",
        "WARNING: As with Gateway's advanced states, Deep Inner requires proper preparation (MABA) and mandatory Integration afterward.",

        "In Deep Inner: Conscious narrative awareness is minimal, Witness awareness may flicker or remain passive, Body awareness is largely absent.",
        "This state borders conscious sleep.",
        "The Gateway research notes: 'At these frequencies, the brain is functioning at a level which provides access to information stored in the subconscious... This is the realm of dreams and deep intuition.'",

        "Design logic: Gradual descent from Theta into Delta, No sharp rhythmic structure, Minimal modulation depth to avoid arousal.",
        "Silence gaps or near-silence may be intentionally used.",
