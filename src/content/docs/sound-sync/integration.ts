        "The CIA's Gateway analysis emphasizes the critical importance of proper return procedures: 'The individual must be brought back through the various Focus levels in a controlled, gradual manner.'",
        "Monroe Institute protocols always include structured return sequences — abrupt termination from deep states can cause disorientation, headaches, or emotional instability.",
        "According to the Gateway document: 'The process of returning to full waking consciousness... must be accomplished gradually to allow the brain to readjust.'",
        "Integration serves what Gateway terms 'grounding' — re-establishing the connection between expanded awareness states and ordinary sensorimotor consciousness.",
        "The Hemi-Sync approach uses ascending frequency sequences to guide the brain back through Alpha into Beta — Integration implements this principle with careful frequency ramping.",

        "Low-to-Mid Beta (12–20 Hz): Executive function, Alertness, Environmental engagement.",
        "During Integration: Theta and Delta are progressively reduced, Sensorimotor awareness returns, Autonomic balance is restored.",
        "Abrupt frequency shifts are avoided.",
        "The Gateway research confirms: 'The return process mirrors the entry process in reverse — gradual frequency increases allow the brain to re-engage with external reality without shock.'",
