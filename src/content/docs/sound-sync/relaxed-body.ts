        "The goal of this state is bodily relaxation without cognitive disengagement.",

        "The CIA's Gateway analysis identifies physical relaxation as essential for consciousness expansion: 'The body must be relaxed to permit the brain hemispheres to achieve synchronization.'",
        "Monroe Institute's Resonant Tuning technique combines breathing exercises with specific audio frequencies to discharge muscular tension — Relaxed Body implements this principle.",
        "According to the Gateway document: 'Physical relaxation and the elimination of stress... are critical prerequisites to achieving the state of expanded awareness.'",
        "The parasympathetic shift induced by Relaxed Body creates the physiological conditions necessary for deeper brainwave entrainment.",
        "Without adequate somatic release, the body's stress signals interfere with the Frequency Following Response, preventing stable Focus state access.",
