      content: [
        "The Mind Awake / Body Asleep (MABA) state is a well-documented transitional consciousness condition where the body enters deep physical relaxation while the mind retains clarity and awareness.",
        "This state corresponds to 'Focus 10' in the CIA Gateway Experience methodology — the foundational threshold state documented in the 1983 analysis (CIA-RDP96-00788R001700210016-5) as the entry point for advanced consciousness work.",
        "In Project ZYGA - SM, MABA serves as the CORE operational state for: Deep meditation, Inner imagery and hypnagogic exploration, Conscious relaxation without loss of awareness, Transition into deeper theta or delta states without unconscious sleep.",
        "The Gateway analysis confirmed this state as a reproducible human capability achieved through Hemi-Sync audio technology — not an anomaly, but a trainable skill.",

      content: [
        "The 1983 CIA document analyzed the Monroe Institute's Gateway Process, which uses binaural beat audio to achieve 'hemispheric synchronization' — coherent oscillation of both brain hemispheres.",
        "Focus 10 (Mind Awake/Body Asleep) was identified as the foundational state: 'the Gateway participant... learns to place his body in a virtual sleep state while his mind... remains operational and alert.'",
        "The Frequency Following Response (FFR): When the brain perceives a binaural beat differential between ears, it naturally synchronizes neural activity to that frequency. A 10 Hz differential entrains alpha waves; 4-7 Hz entrains theta.",
        "This ZYGA implementation targets the alpha-theta boundary (6-10 Hz binaural differential) to induce the Focus 10 state as documented in Gateway research.",

        "Theta (4–8 Hz): Hypnagogia, Memory access, Dream-like imagery, Reduced bodily awareness.",
        "In MABA: Alpha maintains conscious awareness, Theta suppresses somatic (body) signaling.",
        "The balance is critical: Too much Alpha → awake, restless. Too much Theta → unconscious sleep.",
        "Gateway research noted this balance creates the 'consciousness/unconsciousness threshold' — the edge where perception shifts from external to internal reality.",

        "Hemi-Sync methodology: Left ear receives base frequency (e.g., 200 Hz), right ear receives base + differential (e.g., 208 Hz). The brain perceives an 8 Hz 'phantom beat' and synchronizes to it.",
        "Key parameters: Carrier frequency 200–600 Hz, Beat frequency range 6–10 Hz, Amplitude LOW (0.1–0.4 peak).",
